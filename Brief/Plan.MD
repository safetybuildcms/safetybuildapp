## Initial Page

### App Name

SafetyBuild

### Definitions

Lets use Port of Newcastle - PoN (client) contractor (Safetybuild -SB)

### Features

- A landing page for PoN who has contractors (builders, plumbers, carpenters, electricians etc), once they engage you they will send you an email with a link to go onto the site and upload your paperwork.
- Paperwork – PI insurance (not everyone has this), PL insurance (everyone has to have this), Workers Comp (mandatory), Licence, address, main contact (phone and email)
- They upload the documents and type in or click PL insurance, policy number and date of expiry. This needs to have reminders of soon to expire.
- Then the contractor need to upload a new ‘current’ insurance. If they don’t, this information needs to be sent to the client PoN.
- We need to manage these insurances, I need to see if they are legitimate, before we accept them, could say ‘under review’.
- The contractor SB need to be able to see what companies they are working for, they might work for PoN and Orica, so both these 2 logos pop up at the top of the page, you pick which one you are working for and enter and go through the induction? if they only work for one company then only one logo pops up.
- They have a section there were they type in each of their employees and phone number and email address, and pay, they can select how many icons they want to purchase, could be 2 or 5 etc ($40 each worker, each year) so if you have a big company say 20 workers = $40 x 20 per annum = $800, every time they get a new worker they have to pay for them too. say induction date was 12/1/25 expiry will be 12/1/26.
- The worker gets an email and then clicks onto the site, they complete the induction and are sent a certificate, or card with photo, and we should incorporate a bar code? Picture attached, that they can scan on entry. this is good in case of emergency evacuation, who is at the muster point and who is still inside???
- If SB are working for PoN and Orica, they only have to pay for that one worker once each year, maybe good to get other big companies on board.
